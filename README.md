## Overview

This project demonstrates an implementation of the [**Model-View-Intent (MVI)**](https://medium.com/swlh/mvi-architecture-with-android-fcde123e3c4a) architecture and follows [**Clean Architecture**](https://fernandocejas.com/2018/05/07/architecting-android-reloaded/) principles to separate concerns between different layers. It highlights my skills in structured code organization, tests, and modern Android libraries.

## Architecture

This project uses **Clean Architecture** with **MVI** (Model-View-Intent) pattern to separate concerns, scalability, and testability. Hereâ€™s an outline of each layer:

<img height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69e8c015-d2a6-4585-bbcd-e70002b43666">

- **Presentation Layer**: Uses `ViewModel`, `State`, `SideEffect`, `Result`, and `Intent` classes to manage UI-related data and side effects.
- **Domain Layer**: This layer contains the business logic, including `UseCases` for specific operations and `Repository Interfaces` to abstract data sources.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, including API and database. It includes implementations of repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer.

### Presentation Layer:

Let's dive into each component of this layer:
- *Screen*: This class represents the start point of the screen. It receives the ViewModel and the Navigator as parameters.
- *ScreenContent*: This one contains the layout and is created to make the screen easily testable once we inject all the dependencies.
- *ViewModel*: The ViewModel class holds and manages UI-related data; it receives the `Intent`, performs `Actions`, and generates `Results` to be reduced in the new screen `State`.
- *Reducer*: Reducer is responsible for creating the new screen `State` based on the `Results` received from the `ViewModel`.
- SideEffectProcessor: This class generates side effects based on the `Intents`(preSideEffect) and `Result`(postSideEffect). The `SideEffect` is like the [SingleLiveEvent](https://abhiappmobiledeveloper.medium.com/android-singleliveevent-of-livedata-for-ui-event-35d0c58512da), which is responsible for emitting unique events to be handled by the view.

### Data Layer:
The data layer handles data sources and retrieval, whether from APIs, local databases, or other sources. Its primary purpose is to provide data to the domain layer in a standardized format.
This layer contains the following components:
- Repositories: Repositories are the main components of the data layer, providing a clean API for data access and managing data sources (network, database, cache).
- Data Sources: These handle specific data sources, such as RemoteDataSource for API calls and LocalDataSource for database access.
- Mappers: Convert data entities (like API or database DTOs) into domain entities, keeping the data structure consistent with domain needs.

### Domain Layer:
The domain layer focuses on the business logic and is independent of frameworks. It defines how the app operates and interacts with data, which multiple presentation layers can use.
- Use Cases (or Interactors): Encapsulate a specific business action or logic (e.g., fetching a movie detail or saving a record). Use cases pull data from the repository and process it according to business rules.
- Domain Entities: Represent core business entities, passed between layers and kept independent of specific data formats.
- Repository Interface: It defines a contract for data operations but doesnâ€™t specify how data is fetched or stored. This approach allows the domain layer to remain independent of specific data sources, making the architecture more modular and testable.

### Dependency between the layers

This image shows the dependency between the layers, following Uncle Bob's explanation in [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## Dependencies

In this project, we use some of the best libraries to create an Android project. The list is following:

- Compose: ensuring consistent versions of Compose dependencies.
- Material 3: Provides Material Design 3 components in Compose for styling.
- Navigation: Manage the navigation between composable screens.
- Hilt: Provides dependency injection support.
- Coil: An image-loading library with Compose support optimized for Android.
- Coroutines: Provides tools to handle asynchronous programming in a simple, structured way.
- Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests.
- Gson: A converter for Retrofit to parse JSON using Gson.
- Hamcrest: Provides matchers for assertions, enhancing the readability of tests.
- Mockk: A mocking library for Kotlin, useful for testing by simulating dependencies.

## Project structure

The project structure is divided into the following packages, as explained before.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was implemented in 4 days, so it is not modular. The future idea is to migrate the current packages to different modules following the strategy implemented in [this repository](https://github.com/gustavobarbosab/android-compose-playground).

## Setup Instructions

This project setup is simple, and you can follow these steps:
- Clone the project
- Access or create an account on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://developer.themoviedb.org)
- Copy your API Key Auth on [TMDB Developer Auth](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/authentication)
- Paste the API Key on your `local.properties` as the parameter `tmdb.api.key`.
- Run the project =D

```local.properties
  tmdb.api.key=your-key-here
```
